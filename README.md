## Story

I play Wordle sometimes and thought that it's pretty cool. Personally I don't find the Wordle *braggings* useful. They kind of pollute the social media timelines (Facebook, Twitter) but at least they're better than ads 🔥🤷‍♂️.

Then, I came across few "forks" of Wordle:

- [Primel, by David Lawrence](https://twitter.com/millerdl/status/1484286518005051394) - guess a 5 digit prime number.
- [Katla, by Fatih Kalifa](https://twitter.com/pveyes/status/1484454960586579968) - Wordle, in Indonesian language.
- [Thwordle, by Manassarn Manoonchai](https://twitter.com/narze/status/1484596261277900810) - Wordle, in Thai language.
- [Katapat, by Eugene Low](https://amanz.my/2022322924/) - Wordle, in Bahasa Malaysia.

I'm like, "Hey, that's pretty cool, but maybe I could try something else?".

One day, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1484482726644183041):

## Technicalities

### Tech

This game is built with these wonderful technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 14+ (with ESM support)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

Commands:

- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - start a development server

Notes:

- "Unique" IDs are generated for every idiom. They are not 100% unique and are generated with [shorthash2](https://github.com/jecsham/shorthash2). I've tested using this and it's definitely possible to get the same hash for different idioms, if it's used to generate hashes for ALL idioms. Now it's only used for high-frequency idioms (smaller list).
- Generated "keys" for the keyboard are not guaranteed to be persistent for every idiom. They are dynamically generated based on the list of idioms. So if the list of idioms or the order of the idioms changes, the keys will change. This will affect the shared results with emojis (🟩🟧⬜).
- It's possible to fork this and change all idioms.

### Data

⚠️ If you don't want to be spoiled, avoid reading the data marked with 🚨**SPOILERS**🚨.

**Raw data** stored in `data/`.

- List of idioms from [pwxcoo/chinese-xinhua](https://github.com/pwxcoo/chinese-xinhua) via [wenhuangzeng/chinese-idiom-chengyu](https://github.com/wenhuangzeng/chinese-idiom-chengyu/blob/master/src/data/idiom.json).
- 🚨**SPOILERS**🚨 List of [high-frequency idioms from THUOCL (THU Open Chinese Lexicon)](http://thuocl.thunlp.org/source/THUOCL_chengyu.txt). I discovered this via [AllanChain/chinese-wordle](https://github.com/AllanChain/chinese-wordle). GitHub repo: [thunlp/THUOCL](https://github.com/thunlp/THUOCL/blob/master/data/THUOCL_chengyu.txt)

**Game data** stored in `game-data/` are processed by running `npm run data`, which produces two files:

- `all-idioms.txt` - list of *all* idioms, one per line.
- 🚨**SPOILERS**🚨 `game-idioms.csv` - list of idioms to be used in the game, with assigned *"unique"* `id`. This list is mainly from THUOCL's high-frequency idioms.

### Localization

- English: `./i18n/en.json`
- 中文: `./i18n/zh-CN.json`

As of now, 中文 is very roughly translated from English via Google Translate, which may not be great. **Help is needed for translations!**

### Deploying to wordlechinese.com

The fork is hosted at <https://wordlechinese.com/> on Vercel. The repo ships a `vercel.json` that pins:

- `buildCommand: npm run build`
- `outputDirectory: dist`
- `cleanUrls: true`
- a SPA rewrite (`/((?!.*\..*).*) → /index.html`) that catches extension-less paths but lets `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/privacy.html`, and built assets fall through.

To reproduce the deploy from scratch:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, **Add New → Project** and import this GitHub repo. Vercel reads `vercel.json` for the build settings — leave the framework preset on auto-detect.
2. Under **Settings → Environment Variables**, add `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` (e.g. `G-XXXXXXXXXX`) scoped to the **Production** environment only. Leave Preview and Development unset so previews and local builds never fire Google Analytics.
3. Under **Settings → Domains**, add both `wordlechinese.com` and `www.wordlechinese.com`. Vercel will show a CNAME target for each.
4. In Cloudflare, create a CNAME record per Vercel's instructions for each domain. Configure `www.wordlechinese.com` to **301 redirect to apex** so the canonical URL declared in `index.html` (`https://wordlechinese.com/`) wins.
5. Wait for Vercel's "Valid Configuration" indicator on both domains, then verify <https://wordlechinese.com/> serves the new HTML.
6. In Google Search Console, add the `wordlechinese.com` property using DNS TXT verification (record goes in Cloudflare) and submit `https://wordlechinese.com/sitemap.xml`.

The legacy `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` GitHub Pages job is kept as a fallback for now and is not the production target.
